problem in Double_track_model: Cannot continue simulation at time ....... error was popping.
Made another 2-track model: - updated 2-track_model 
problem in this was that traction force on each wheel was negative.
Complete double-track model was ready with camber, caster and toe dynamics added in it. Didn't upload the load_data file coz github doesn't allow to add files which are larger than 25 MBs
